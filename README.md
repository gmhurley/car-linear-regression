# car-linear-regression

##Plaid Coat
###Description

Practice using linear regression through exercises looking at data on car sales.

###Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to:

Use scikit-learn to perform linear regression
Understand single-variable and multiple-variable linear regression
Decide when to use polynomial linear regression of differing degrees
Understand the use dummy variables when fitting lines with linear regression

###Deliverables

A Git repo called linear-regression containing at least:
a requirements.txt file
car-worth.ipynb
supporting data files

###Normal Mode

Go through the car-worth.ipynb file included with this repository and add cells to address the prompts, exploring the data through the use of pandas and scikit-learn.

Your final submission should be a well-organized IPython notebook file with charts and data exploring linear relationships in the data.
